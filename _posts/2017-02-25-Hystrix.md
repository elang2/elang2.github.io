Its very common for an organization which have adopted the micro-services architecture to deal with hundreds of different services, each with 
it's own performance and reliability as Service Level Agreement (SLA).

There will also be services which have dependency on other services. Given the different SLA's of the services we don't want the end-user experience to be impacted when one or more services in the eco system go down or are unable to meet the required SLA's. 

In short we want the entire microservice based application to be resilient to failure and always make a best attempt to not impact user experience.


Here, I will explain how we can leverage <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a> a Netflix library which implements the <a href="">Circuit Breaker Pattern</a> to build resilient microservices.


### Key advantages of Circuit Breaker Pattern:

1. Fail fast and rapid recovery.
2. Prevent cascading failure.
3. Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.


### Hystrix library in addition to enabling the 'Circuit Breaker Pattern' help with the following :

1. Near real time monitoring via. Hystrix stream and Hystrix dasboard.
2. Generate monitoring events which can be published to external systems like Graphite.   


### Use Case:

Shown below is 'News Feed Aggregation Service' which returns activity feed for an user. Think of it like a facebook like timeline feed for an user.

The aggregation service has dependency on 3 other micro-services for feed data and data for feed enrichment purpose. News Feed service being the primary source of feed whose data is further enriched based on the information retrieved from user-service and photo-service.

Users news feed is shown on the landing page of the application after the user logs in and it provides an overview of the activities that have
taken place between now and the last time the user was on the site. Hence, it is of utmost importance that the operation of fetch the required new feed data is fast and reliable. 

We neither want the user to see a long 'loading...' animation or see no data at all since. The backend service need to be highly resilient.

Here's a flow diagram indicating how the user feed is fetched and enriched. The Newsfeed Aggregation service has three clients, each talking to different services (news feed, user and photo service).

Each client has a certain 'Read Time Out' and 'Connect Time Out' associated with it.
Lets assume these are configured to be 3 seconds each. So, if dependent services don't respond back in 3s or if the calling service is unable to establish a connection within 3 seconds, a read or connect timeout exception is thrown by the client.

In the happy path scenario, everything will work as usual and the dependent service will return data within some miliseconds. The application is able to retrieve the feed and return it to the user.

However, if one of the dependent services go down then every user will see at least a 3 seconds increase in the response time to return partial data or no data at all.
The page will be slower and user experience not so good.

Using the Hystrix library, we can have the service execute a fallback operation when a certain threshold of failure rate for talking to an external service is reached. This is essentially a state where the circuit is considered open. As soon as the circuit is open, the service only executes the fallback operation and avoids reaching out to the external service for a certain cooldown period. Thus, saving the expensive 3 second timeout period for each API call to the external service.

After the cool down period, Hystrix will allow one request to go out to the external service, if this succeeds then the circuit will be closed again and all subsequent calls will reach out to the external service until the threshold for failure is reached next time.
