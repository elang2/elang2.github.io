Its very common for an organization which have adopted the micro-services architecture to deal with hundreds of different services, each with 
it's own performance and reliability as Service Level Agreement (SLA).

There will also be services which have dependency on other services. Given the different SLA's of the services we don't want the end-user experience to be impacted when one or more services in the eco system go down or are unable to meet the required SLA's. 

In short we want the entire microservice based application to be resilient to failure and always make a best attempt to not impact user experience.


Here, I will explain how we can leverage <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a> a Netflix library which implements the <a href="">Circuit Breaker Pattern</a> to build resilient micro services.


### Key advantages of Circuit Breaker Pattern:

1. Fail fast and rapid recovery.
2. Prevent cascading failure.
3. Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.


### Hystrix library in addition to enabling the 'Circuit Breaker Pattern' help with the following :

1. Near real time monitoring via. Hystrix stream and Hystrix dasboard.
2. Generate monitoring events which can be published to external systems like Graphite.   


### Use Case:

Shown below is 'News Feed Aggregation Service' which returns activity feed for an user. Think of it like a facebook like timeline feed for an user.

The aggregation service has dependency on 3 other micro-services for feed data and data for feed enrichment purpose. News Feed service being the primary source of feed whose data is further enriched based on the information retrieved from user-service and photo-service.

Users news feed is shown on the landing page of the application after the user logs in and it provides an overview of the activities that have
taken place between now and the last time the user was on the site. Hence, it is of utmost importance that the operation of fetch the required new feed data is fast and reliable. 

We neither want the user to see a long 'loading...' animation or see no data at all since. The backend service need to be highly resilient.

Here's a flow diagram indicating how the user feed is fetched and enriched. The Newsfeed Aggregation service has three clients, each talking to different services (news feed, user and photo service).

Each client has a certain 'Read
